<p>During the 2014-2015 academic year, I have worked to develop an electronic textbook for Introduction to Robotics at WPI. The five chapters, linked above, were deemed to be five of the more important or difficult topics taught during the course. Most content comes from lectures created by Professors Stafford, Miller, and Gennert. Most graphics have been created specifically for this project and animations are coming soon.</p>

	<div class="col-md-8"><p>This is a video of a simulation of the ABB Robot in the Washburn Machine shops at WPI. The robot was programmed to pick up Lincoln Logs and place them in the correct order to build a house. Because of scheduling conflicts, the team was not able to get a recording of the robot executing the full program, but this simulation is an accurate representation of the final product.</p></div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8"><p>This is a simulation of the sorting algorithm given to the ABB robot. The blocks were placed in a feeder station. The feeder station had sensors to determine the size of the block about to be picked up. If the block picked up was the correct size, the robot would place it in the house. If the block was the incorrect size, the robot would place it in a separate holding area. The program was created using a psuedo-random sequence; that is, it used a perfect sequence of blocks with ten extra blocks placed in random places. This simulation was created because the code was finished weeks before the robot was ready for actual testing.</p></div>
